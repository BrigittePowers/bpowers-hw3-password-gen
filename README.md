# bpowers-hw3-password-gen

The purpose of this project was to create a password generator that is able to take user-selected criteria and output a randomized password containing all requirements. The code is designed to first accept user criteria that needs to be in the password. It then generates a password and runs it through a validation function to make sure the randomized password fits all user-expected criteria. The code is also optimized for instances where the user might try to generate a password with no criteria selected or criteria outside of accepted parameters. In these instances, the interface will inform the user of any missing criteria. 

In a proper use-case scenario, a user will...<br>
... be able to select criteria needed in their generated password<br>
... be shown a password that matches their choices made<br>
... be able to re-generate new passwords, make new selections, or copy the password to their clipboard<br>

The project is live at: https://brigittepowers.github.io/bpowers-hw3-password-gen/

It should load with the checkbox div hidden, visible once a button is pressed.
